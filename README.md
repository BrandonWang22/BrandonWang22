- # Hi, my name is Brandon Wang
- I am new in the world of Computer Science and I want to learn more about it. I decided to take this course since it will be beneficial for me to learn how to program.
- My other academic interest is Biology
- My goals for this class is to make a playable game that has pretty good controls and has little to no bugs
- My worries for this class is that I won't be able to use programming languages to their full extent and I am worried that I won't create a good program in time for the deadlines.
